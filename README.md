# TablingScheduling
A simple tabling scheduling program that takes multiple people's available
times, and outputs a fair schedule of members at the table, within the
constraints given by each member's available times.

Makes use of dynamic programming to get as close to the optimal fairness
solution as possible.

Partial Credit is the best!
# Usage
``` python3 schedule.py ```

Currently schedule is just a test to see whether the algorithm works as it is
supposed to, will soon expand program to accept new members, enter available
times and days, and output the tabling schedule
